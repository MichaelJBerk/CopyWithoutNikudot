[Download the latest release here](https://github.com/MichaelJBerk/CopyWithoutNikudot/releases/latest)

Installation
-
Double-Click on the "Copy Without Nikud" file. macOS will ask you if you'd like to install it, so click "Install" to proceed.

Usage
-
If you find Hebrew text with Nikudot, just select and right-click it. From the dropdown menu, choose "Services" and click "Copy Without Nikudot". The text will then be copied to the clipboard without Nikudot, and you can paste the text wherever you like.

Uninstallation
-
If you already know how to remove a Service in macOS, there's nothing new here.

Open the Finder. In the Menu Bar, click "Go" and choose "Go to Folder..." from the dropdown.
In the panel that just opened, type `~/Library/Services/`. 
From this folder, just delete the "Remove Nikudot" file.

Keyboard Shortcut
-
If you find yourself using this quite often, you may want to set a Keyboard Shortcut for it. To do so, open System Preferences, click "Keyboard", then "Shortcuts", then "Services". Under the "Text" category, click the "Copy Without Nikudot" service, and click the "Add Shortcut" button that appears.
